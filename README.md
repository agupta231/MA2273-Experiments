# MA2273 Experiments

A series of programs I wrote that either prove problems or implement algorithms in
*Constructive Combinatorics* by Dennis Stanton and Dennis White. All the programs are
written in Python 3.

## List Lex
This program will print out the values in `n choose k` in lexicographical order.
Run `python lex_list.py n k` from the command line, where n and k are the values in
`n choose k`, respectively.

## Johnson Trotter Unrank
This program will print out the permutation that is ranked `m` in the Johnson-Trotter
ordering. Run. `python johnson_trotter_unrank.py m n` from the command line, where `m` is
the rank, and `n` stands for `[n]`. 

## List Colex
This will print out the values of `n choose k` in colexicographical order. Run `python
list_colex.py n k` from the command line, where n and k are the values in `n choose k`,
respectively.
